Architecture Overview
---------------------

The GLSP-Rust system implements a revolutionary AI-native graphical modeling platform with the following key architectural components:

- **MCP Protocol Layer**: JSON-RPC based communication for AI agents
- **WASM Component System**: 15 production-ready ADAS components with sandboxing
- **AI Integration Layer**: Natural language processing and machine learning
- **Database Layer**: Multi-backend support (PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, Redis)
- **Simulation Engine**: Time-driven scenario execution
- **Frontend System**: High-performance Canvas rendering with TypeScript
