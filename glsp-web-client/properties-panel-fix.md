# Properties Panel Integration Fix

## Problem
The properties panel in the sidebar was not showing element properties when nodes or edges were clicked.

## Root Cause
The InteractionManager was handling element clicks but not communicating the selection to the UIManager's properties panel.

## Solution

### 1. Connected InteractionManager to UIManager
- Added UIManager reference to InteractionManager
- Added `setUIManager()` method to InteractionManager
- Connected this in AppController initialization

### 2. Updated Click Handling
- Modified `handleRendererInteraction()` to update properties panel on element clicks
- Added `updatePropertiesPanel()` method to format element data for the properties panel
- Clear properties panel when clicking empty canvas

### 3. Enhanced Properties Panel Content
- Updated `updateSelectedElement()` in UIManager to show comprehensive properties
- Added different property groups based on element type:
  - **General Properties**: ID, Label, Type
  - **Layout**: Position and Size (X, Y, Width, Height)
  - **WASM Component**: Component Name, Loaded Status, Interface Count
  - **Connection** (for edges): Source/Target elements, Routing points
  - **Custom Properties**: Any additional element properties

### 4. Element Type Detection
- Proper detection of nodes vs edges based on element type
- Special handling for WASM components to show component-specific properties

## Testing
1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Create or load a diagram
3. Click on any node or edge
4. The properties panel should now show:
   - Element details
   - Position and size
   - Type-specific properties
   - Custom properties from the backend

## Files Modified
- `/src/ui/InteractionManager.ts`: Added properties panel integration
- `/src/ui/UIManager.ts`: Enhanced properties panel content
- `/src/AppController.ts`: Connected InteractionManager to UIManager

## Benefits
- Better user experience with detailed element inspection
- Easy debugging of element properties
- Foundation for future property editing capabilities
- Clear visualization of WASM component metadata
