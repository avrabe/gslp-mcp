# Edge Selection Fix

## Problem
Users couldn't select edges by clicking on them, making it impossible to view edge properties in the properties panel.

## Root Cause
The `getElementAt()` method in CanvasRenderer only checked for elements with bounds (nodes), but edges don't have bounds - they have routing points and source/target connections.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Hit Detection Algorithm
- Added `isPointOnEdge()` method that calculates if a click point is within tolerance of an edge
- Uses point-to-line-segment distance calculation
- Accounts for routing points and multi-segment edges
- Zoom-aware tolerance (8 pixels at current zoom level)

### 2. Updated Element Detection
- Modified `getElementAt()` to check edges after nodes
- Comprehensive edge type detection for various edge types:
  - `edge`, `flow`, `association`, `dependency`
  - `sequence-flow`, `message-flow`, `conditional-flow`

### 3. Improved Visual Feedback
- Selected edges: 3px line width
- Hovered edges: 2px line width  
- Normal edges: 1px line width
- Selected/hovered edges use selection color

### 4. Better Type Classification
- Enhanced edge vs node detection in InteractionManager
- Improved property panel handling for edges

## Technical Details

### Point-to-Line-Segment Distance Algorithm
```typescript
private distanceToLineSegment(point: Position, lineStart: Position, lineEnd: Position): number {
    // Uses vector math to find shortest distance from point to line segment
    // Handles cases where closest point is at line endpoints
}
```

### Edge Segment Handling
- Handles direct edges (source → target)
- Handles edges with routing points (source → point1 → point2 → target)
- Each segment is checked for proximity to click point

## Testing
1. Create a diagram with nodes and edges
2. Try clicking on edges - they should now be selectable
3. Selected edges should appear thicker and use selection color
4. Properties panel should show edge details when selected

## Files Modified
- `/src/renderer/canvas-renderer.ts`: Added edge hit detection
- `/src/ui/InteractionManager.ts`: Improved edge type detection

## Result
Users can now easily select and inspect edges, with clear visual feedback and detailed properties in the sidebar panel.
