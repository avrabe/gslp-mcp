Welcome to the documentation for the **ADAS WASM Components Demo** - a comprehensive demonstration of how the GLSP-MCP platform can be used to build complex systems like Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.

.. important::
   **This is demonstration code only!** This workspace contains example implementations that showcase:
   
   * How GLSP-MCP can be used for complex modeling scenarios
   * Concepts from ISO 26262 applied to WebAssembly components
   * AI integration patterns using WASI-NN
   * Multi-component system architecture
   
   **This code is NOT intended for production use.** It serves as a learning resource and proof-of-concept
   for developers exploring the capabilities of the GLSP-MCP platform.

Overview
--------

The ADAS WASM Components demo illustrates how to use GLSP-MCP for complex systems by implementing:

* **15 Example Components** demonstrating sensor, AI, control, and system functions
* **Real AI Integration** showing WASI-NN usage with YOLOv5n neural network
* **ISO 26262 Concepts** demonstrating how safety principles can be applied
* **WebAssembly Component Model** showcasing secure, isolated execution
* **Bazel Build System** with custom WASM rules as a build system example

Purpose and Learning Goals
--------------------------

This ADAS demo serves as an educational example showing:

1. **How to Structure Complex GLSP-MCP Applications**: Learn patterns for multi-component systems
2. **Domain-Specific Implementations**: See how to apply GLSP-MCP to specialized domains like automotive
3. **Safety Concepts in Practice**: Understand how formal safety principles translate to code
4. **Advanced Integration Patterns**: Explore AI integration, sensor fusion, and real-time processing

**Remember**: This is demonstration code meant for learning. Always perform proper safety analysis and validation for any production system.
