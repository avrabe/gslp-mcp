✅ Object detection: 10.6MB with embedded YOLOv5n
✅ All components using correct WASI-NN version
✅ Component loading and inspection working
```

### 3. Confirmed Technical Architecture
```bash

🧠 This component includes:
   • YOLOv5n ONNX model (3.8MB)
   • WASI-NN integration for inference
   • Object detection algorithms
   • Automotive safety interfaces
```

## 🔧 How to Use the System

### 1. Use the Built Runtime
```bash
# Add to your PATH
export PATH=/Users/r/git/glsp-rust/workspace/adas-wasm-components/wasmtime-wasi-nn-build/target/release:$PATH

# Verify WASI-NN support
wasmtime run -S help | grep nn
# Output: nn[=y|n] -- Enable support for WASI neural network API
```

### 2. Run Simple Tests
```bash
# Test WASI-NN availability
wasmtime run -S nn=y simple-test.wasm

# Test component loading
wasmtime run --dir . test-loading.wasm
```

### 3. Component Integration (Next Steps)
Your ADAS components are library components that need to be integrated into a host application. They export these interfaces:

```wit
export adas:control/ai-control;
export adas:data/perception-data;
export adas:diagnostics/health-monitoring;
export adas:diagnostics/performance-monitoring;
```
